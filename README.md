## 1. What is ALPS?

ALPS is a parallelised numerical code that solves the Vlasov-Maxwell dispersion
relation in hot (even relativistic) magnetised plasma. ALPS allows for any
number of particle species with arbitrary gyrotropic background distribution
functions supporting waves with any direction of propagation with respect to
the background magnetic field.

If you use the code for a science publication,

1. please provide the code website [github.com/danielver02/ALPS](https://github.com/danielver02/ALPS) in the acknowledgements,
2. cite the DOI of the code:

##  3. Installing the ALPS code

For advice on the installation of the code, please check [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md)


##  4. Running the ALPS code

ALPS works with input files that specify the plasma and numerical parameters for
the calculation. We recommend that you start by checking out the provided test
cases as a guidance for the creation of input files. These test cases are listed
in the scripts `run_test.sh` and `run_test_suite.sh` in the subfolder `./tests`. All associated input files have
a name starting with `test_`.

You can execute the ALPS code through the following command:

```
mpirun -np <NP> ./src/ALPS <input_file.in>
```

where `<NP>` is the number of processors you want to use. This number must be greater
than or equal to 4, and it must be an even number. `<input_file.in>` is the input file
that includes all parameters for your run.

On some systems, depending on the MPI configuration, the oversubscribe flag is
required. In this case, the above command must be replaced with

```
mpirun -np <NP> --oversubscribe ./src/ALPS <input_file.in>
```

For first-time users, we recommend working through our [ALPS Tutorial](tutorial.md). The key input parameters for ALPS are described on the [ALPS Input](input.md) page. The output format of ALPS is described on the [ALPS Output](output.md) page.
